description: "I have been using Notion a bunch recently. It's great.\n\nI wrote this post to share my thinking around some small design choices in Notion. \nMy goal was a humble exploration of the incredible nuance and detail involved with crafting a great product. \n\nMy suggestions are all tiny and they're not priorities for Notion, nor are they meant to be. I would much rather have the Notion API released a tiny bit sooner than any of these changes made \U0001F642 \n\nThis article might be a bit hard to follow if you're not familiar with Notion."
