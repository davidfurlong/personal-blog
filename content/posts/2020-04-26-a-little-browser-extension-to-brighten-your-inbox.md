Like many people in tech I bought into the [superhuman](https://superhuman.com/) email client hype. I begged for an invite. I tried it and discovered I didn't need it. I just had to learn how to manage my mailbox better. 

One thing that I missed after I cancelled the $30/month Superhuman subscription was the beautiful background images Superhuman showed me when I reached inbox zero. 

This browser extension makes your gmail inbox zero a beautiful image, fresh every day from the Unsplash API.
