**Here's a list of nudges I use to reduce addictive/thoughtless consumption of the digital**

* Mute all non utility notifications from apps and companies (emails & on phone & laptop)
* Don't let notifications interrupt your usage of your phone
* Turn your phone on black and white mode
* Put your most addictive apps on the last screen of your phone
* Use _Motion_ browser extension to nudge me off distracting websites during focused hours
* Use _uBlock origin_ and block all browser ads. Use a similar extension for mobile browsing ads.
* Unsubscribe from all marketing emails
* Disable faceid (use passcode to slow you down)
* Install _I don't care about cookies_ browser extension
* Install _Block the youtube feed_ browser extension 
* Turn on automatic do not disturb after 9pm on your phone
* Put your phone on silent 24/7
* Delete apps that are non utility apps (for example facebook)
* Use facebook messenger lite rather than messenger
* Disable notifications altogether of too addicting apps
* Gatekeep the release of dopamine by implanting smart electrodes in my brain (just joking, but would be nice)
