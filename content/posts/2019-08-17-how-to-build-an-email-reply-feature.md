## Why its useful

People use your app to accomplish a goal, not to gaze confusingly at your snazzy new interface where half the buttons are not where they used to be. Their goal is not navigating your apps experimental navigation, nor trying to remember which email and password or social login they used for your app's login with your _must contain atleast 12 characters, !$_- password policy_.

Their goal I describe in this post is to respond to a new message notification in their email inbox, and the fastest and simplest way for them to do that is to reply to the email. 

> _If your app has message threads that are transactional in nature, and you care about transaction success rates, you probably want to provide this shortcut for users. See limitations at the end of this article for when you might not want to provide this functionality._
