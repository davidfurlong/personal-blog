  Categorizing volunteering intent into two categories: sacrificial and non
  sacrificial. 


  Sacrificial is when we agree to volunteer against our best incentives, and out
  of a feeling of duty or sacrifice for the good of others. We'd rather be doing
  something else in other words, but our guilt or sense of obligation drives us
  to volunteer.
